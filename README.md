# Culminating-10
An interactive webmap of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
The `Progress` folder isn't necessary, as it is essentially just a checklist.
All map data is stored in the `mapData` folder. Feel free to reuse any of it in your own projects.

## Visual Studio
If Visual Studio is being used to view the project, copy the absolute path of `index.html` in the `Culminating-10-main` folder and replace the launch.json url with it.
